# Literate Programming in ConTeXt

This project is really a pair of tools to enable efficient programming in
a literate environment.

This project consists of:

1. a command line tool (lpc), written in Python, to extract the code and
build a Ninja build file to build the code, and

2. a ConTeXt module (litProg) to inform the ConTeXt typesetting engine how
to typeset the code and its associated literate description.
